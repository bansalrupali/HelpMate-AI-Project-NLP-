Exploring Project Options
In this segment, we will present you with multiple options for building the end-to-end project. These options are intended to provide you with diverse opportunities to apply the skills you have developed so far and apply your creative skills. Let's explore these options in detail.

Option 1: Build a RAG System

If you prefer a structured project with a clear starting point, you can build a project in the insurance domain, similar to the project in the module ‘Retrieval Augmented Generation with LlamaIndex’. The goal of the project will be to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from various insurance policy documents. You may use LangChain or LlamaIndex to build the generative search application.
 
Option 2: Build Your Own Project (BYOP)

Under the ‘Build Your Own Project’ option, you can conceive, design, develop and implement your own AI-driven project. This is an exciting opportunity to explore your passion for AI and create an AI system that can impact any domain you choose. Let’s discuss some project ideas to spark your imagination.
 
Search Systems
The list below demonstrates some sample projects that you can undertake in building a search application with an LLM.
Email Search AI: Develop a generative search system for emails that helps organisation find and validate past decisions, stratagies, and data in a huge corpus of email threads. Here is a dataset from Kaggle that might be useful for this endeavour.
Fashion Search AI: Create a generative search system capable of searching a plethora of product descriptions to find and recommend appropriate choices against a user query. You may use this Myntra dataset on Kaggle to build such a system.
Product recommendation systems: Build a content-based product recommendation system that recommends products to users based on their preferences. You may refer to the ‘ShopAssist AI’ project to craft the problem statement for the project.
 
Agent Systems
LLMs can be used as building blocks to create reasoning agents very easily with the help of frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex. Here are a couple of project ideas that you can build around the concept of agents:
Conversational agent: Develop a conversational agent that uses LangChain to engage in natural conversations with users, providing information based on the context of the queries.
Data Analytics Agent: Build a Python agent that can perform data analytics on a given data set by converting natural language queries into detailed insights and reports. You can use a pandas-based agent or a CSV agent for creating the data analytics agent system.
SQL Agent: Build an SQL agent that can fetch and analyse information from various databases and perform data retrieval and processing based on the user’s query.
 
As you work on your custom project, remember to document your progress meticulously. Create comprehensive documentation that outlines your project's goals, the model used, data sources, key design decisions and any challenges you encountered.

Note: Remember, you can source data for your project from publicly available data sets from platforms like Kaggle or even collect the data yourself. The key is choosing a project that aligns with your interests and objectives and has a meaningful application in the real world.

It should be noted that in this project, you can use either LangChain or LlamaIndex frameworks to solve an end-to-end problem statement.
